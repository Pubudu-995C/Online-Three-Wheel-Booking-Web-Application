              Passengers and drivers expect each other to act appropriately and
              respect boundaries. It is disrespectful to make derogatory remarks
              about a person or group. Furthermore, commenting on appearance,
              asking overly personal questions and making unwanted physical
              contact are all considered inappropriate behaviors. Anyone who
              solicits or engages in sexual conduct while using the Tuktukmango
              platform may lose future access to Tuktukmango. We encourage you
              to be mindful of other users’ privacy and personal space. Violence
              of any kind will not be tolerated.{" "}

              Calm and clear communication is the most effective way to defuse
              any disagreement that may arise between you and Driver. All
              Passengers and drivers expect to be treated with respect and
              courtesy by one another. This expectation extends to personal
              property as well. As a Passenger, it is your responsibility to
              treat your driver’s vehicle with respect and not intentionally
              damage or remove their personal items from it. As a
              driver-partner, it is your responsibility to make every reasonable
              effort to return any lost items in your vehicle. It is best to
              treat a lost item respectfully. It is unacceptable to require
              additional payment to return an item; doing so could cause you to
              lose access to the Tuktukmango platform.
